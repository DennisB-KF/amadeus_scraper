# amadeus_scraper
A tool to track the amount of listed positions and the market cap of AAD.DE

The script allows to scrap the amount of listed positions, as indicated on the homepage of Amadeus Fire AG, along with the current market cap.

The purpose is to establish data-series of the two variables and determine thier relationship and eventual deviations (e.g. when the amount of listed positions substantially exceeds the historical average, while the market cap is significatly below its historical values).

The tool can be used as an additional source of information regarding the investment decision.
